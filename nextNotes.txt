Run the app by running dev script from package.json "npm run dev".
------------------------------------------------------------------

NEXT JS 13 has app folder, which contains layout.tsx and page.tsx (default route will redirect to page.tsx which is first child of app folder 
and layout.tsx contains the layout which will be applied to every page.tsx in the sme level and in the child level.)

Layout.tsx in the app folder has const "metadata". This "metadata" is reserved constant in Next 13 layout file where we can control
the title, description and othe options.

NEXT JS Fonts

const font = Nunito({
  subsets: ['latin']  
});

https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Latin_script#:~:text=The%20ISO%20basic%20Latin%20alphabet,x%20Yy%20Zz
Here subsets means the ISO basic Latin alphabet, which is composed of 26 uppercase letters (ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ) and 26 lowercase versions of the same letters (abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz), resulting in the following pairs:
Aa Bb Cc Dd Ee Ff Gg Hh Ii Jj Kk Ll Mm Nn Oo Pp Qq Rr Ss Tt Uu Vv Ww Xx Yy Zz

className={font.className} // font.className will autogenerate class. 
The "className={font.className}" will apply this autogenerated class to our entire document.

Why should not we use font links in index.html?
Though this will work, but it comes with some issues:
Issue 1. First, the fallback font loads which is the system font, and then roboto is used.
In case of slow internet speeds, this will look a lot more painful.
Issue 2. Further, we have to make requests to google fonts to go retrieve this external font file every single time.

Solution: Host the font on our own NEXTJS Server and automatically figure out what the fall back font should be so that it 
perfectly matches and has the least amount of layout shift.
This is exactly what is been done by font optimization inside NEXT JS.
